# cs360_HW4

This project effectively simulates the pipe command in Linux. 

Instead of using the '|' operator, a user could run this executable, following the below format.

To Compile:
      Use the gcc compiler to compile the program. The assignment4.c file contains a main.
      (i.e. gcc -o assignment4 assignment4.c).

To Execute: 
./assignment4 <arg1> : <arg2>

  Where: <arg1> and <arg2> are optional parameters that specify the programs
    to be run. If <arg1> is specified but <arg2> is not, then <arg1> should be
    run as though there was not a colon. Same for if <arg2> is specified but
    <arg1> is not.
